# High Level Design
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose of High Level Design Document
- The High-Level Design Document (HLD) serves as a communication tool and blueprint for software development, aligning stakeholders on the project's vision, goals, and scope while providing a structured overview of the system architecture, components, and interactions, guiding implementation, and facilitating collaboration among team members.
### 1.2 Scope
## 2. General Description
### 2.1 Product Perspective
SimuWare operates as a software application, providing a 3D virtual environment for component assembly and simulation. It may interact with external tools or libraries for specific functionalities, such as physics engines or circuit analysis algorithms.
### 2.2 Tool Used
- 
### 2.3 Constraints
- Hardware Requirements:-
- Platform Compatibility:-
### 2.4 Assumptions
It is assumed that the design of such a document will allow the detection of flaws early on in the software development life cycle. It is assumed that the design that is to be described in this document is feasible and implementable. There is also an assumption that none of the work or hardware will be stolen or sabotaged.

## 3. Design Details
### 3.1 Main Design Features

### 3.2 Application Architecture

### 3.3 Technology Architecture

### 3.4 User Interface

### 3.5 Error Handling

### 3.6 Performance
- The project aims to have minimal hit on the performance of the actual software itself. This is important as the objective of analysis will be defeated if the software run time details are malformed. The frontend application must have acceptably fast load times for visual information. The API performance must not act as a bottleneck for the application as this can hinder the data collection process. Good internet connectivity is considered a prerequisite for the application to function as intended. The database must have usable read and write times.

### 3.7 Security

### 3.8 Reliability

### 3.9 Maintainability

### 3.10 Portability

### 3.11 Reusability
